# Description

Here is mine Mac Os liked customed powertoys keyboard manager settings.
As `CTRL` is much more frequency used than `ALT`, Mac Os offered more accessable way when coding with shortcuts by using ur cutie right thumb instead of little finger! 
Thus, here i switched `CTRL` and `ALT`, but it's not even enough, i'd like to replace more convenient shortcuts such as replace `ALT+F4` to `command+w`, etc.

# Usage
- close power toys
- open power toys install folder: `cd %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\PowerToys\Keyboard Manager`
- replace or create defalut.json
- enjoy!



# Details

Basically, u can get all config at PowerToys Settings. But here i'd like to have a general description about mapping key and reason:

--- 
`Ctrl(left)` -> `Alt(Left)`

`Alt(left)` -> `Ctrl(left)`

switch `Ctrl` and `Alt` to match Mac Os keyboard.

--- 
`Caps Lock` -> `Shift(left)`

`Print Screen` -> `Caps Lock`

`Caps Lock` is a quite low frequency key in daily coding conditions but easy to miss-pressed, and after u work with Mac Os for a while, short press `Caps Lock` to switch language between CH and ENG is such a easy and resonable setting, then here i mapped `Caps Lock` to `Shift(left)` to make it have same effect as Mac Os.
